# Impact of Coronavirus on Indian Economy

After every economic crisis there are 5 ways in which economy of a country can go:

1. Progression
2. Stagnation
3. Recession
4. Depression
5. The great depression
   India's economic crisis is not a new thing, it has been there from past two years slowly and slowly crippling the nation.
   There are three things which can happen to companies after this crisis :
6. V curve :
   The economy will increase as it has gone down as after the 5th stage it is proved that country will rebound.
7. U curve :
   Here the economy goes very down in a short span of time and rebounds after some buffer time and shoots up to the sky.
8. L curve :
   This one is the most dangerous curve. Here the economy goes down but takes very long time(in decades) to revive.
   Due to this Virus many sectors have boomed like :
9. E-commerce market places : Due to this people are unable to go out and online markets have boomed.
10. Unmanned Vehicles : Different companies like JD.com of China is providing unmanned vehicles for transportation of essential goods. It has also been providing unmanned shops,unmanned warehouses in which robots do all jobs. Recently it also launched its drone delivery and helped many people in Wuhan.
11. Gaming and Streaming Firms : Many people are free and need something to spend their time due to which this sector is booming.
12. Logistics and Delivery : As people are not allowed to go out ,so the logistics and delivery teams are having some great time. For example : In Chandigarh, Swiggy and Zomato drivers are doing the delivery of groceries.
13. Video Conferencing : Due to temporary closure of almost all offices,all the meetings/discussions were shifted online of different video conferencing platforms like : Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Adobe Connect, Skype,Cisco Webex etc and they saw immense traffic on their servers.
14. Non-Cyclical Business : They are providing the essential commodities/services whose requirement can never decrease. Eg : Colgate, Dettol, Hindustan Unilever, Amul, Haldirams etc which deal in day to day commodities whose requirement can never decrease.
15. Pharmaceutical Firms : The need of medicines/supplements can never decrease but only increases from time to time. This is one of the very few sectors which are inelastic and its sales can never decrease.
    But also We can see that many sectors have gone down and here heavily impacted by this like :
16. Airlines Sector : This is very crucial sector as it is not working at all and they always provide services on very less margin due to fierce competition.
17. Travel Sector : All modes of transportation have been impacted as none of them is working.
18. Cinemas/Theatres : People cannot be brought to one place to show some kind of entertainment so they have also been impacted.
19. Investment Sector : Most of the people Investing in Shares and mutual funds have withdrawn their money as shares have gone low for all sectors and it will take much time for this sector to revive as the sentiments of market have gone down.
20. Oil and Gas : Due to very less usage of travel sector there is no firm to purchase oil and gas.
21. Tourism : Due to very less usage of travel sector there is no tourist who can go to visit places and this sector has also been impacted.
22. Professional Sports : All the professional sport meets have been cancelled/postponed until further notice.
23. Restaurants : People are afraid to eat junk food so they have also been impacted
    And many other sectors have been affected.
    Some Sectors are In-betweener that is their future depends on the way they adapt to new technology and processes. These sectors are :
24. Manufacturing
25. Healthcare
26. Education
27. Banking
    They need to adapt to the new changes or they will go down.
    Now talking about the economy. The economy depends directly on consumption which has decreased but will further decrease as the people will be afraid to spend money and save it for any future mishappening.
    So now what comes into play is getting “Long Term Geo-Political Advantage”. India can take help of ongoing trade and political war between USA and China , the future relations are meant to deferred.
    India can come and supply that goods to America and gain long term advantage.
    What also comes into play is minimizing the cost on this pandemic as our government has very minimum amount of money to spend on it as the income tax collection from past 2 years has gone down, this is also the reason that our country was one of the few countries who have locked down the country in the initial phase of virus transmission.
    Also after the pandemic due to previous quarters of poor economy Indi mainly requires three things to be strong which are :
28. Consumption of goods
29. Export of goods
30. Foreign Investment
    The Next quarter will be having a major role in proving that the result will be progression, stagnation or depression. It will also be a important for the government to ensure proper utilisation of public money and making new amendments to adapt to different and effective processes for the future.
