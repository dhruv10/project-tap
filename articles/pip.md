# Pain is Positive

If you ever get to know the sadness behind the smiling faces, you would never believe in the reality of the smiles.

Some cry to vent out their pain but some hide it behind their beautiful smile. In times of pain everybody needs an ear that listens, that understands, that helps them heal.

Be someone's go-to person in times of difficulty. Be the candle that ends their darkness. Be the ray of hope in thier black hole.

Make them believe in the saneness of the world and the series of events that happen to teach something important that needs to be taught.

Pain is a beautiful word.
You all may be thinking why is it a beautiful word? Here is the answer, a word that is related to emotions, feelings but this pain will also reveal the face of the people who will support you or push you into darkness. It will tell you about those who left you in times of difficulty and those who held you tight and heard you.

Pain shall pass but it will always leave you with sense of positivity and will teach you a lesson that you needed to learn.
