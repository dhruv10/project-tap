<b>My Experience</b>
<br />
Nowadays, people are also making a career in music because they want to
follow their passion, their dreams, and I am one of them. I am also a
student of this organization and just completed my junior diploma and
now pursuing a senior diploma. I have experience of 3 years in this
music institute. And I feel that in these 3 years I have improved myself
so well. I get hesitant whenever I have to sing or perform something,
slowly and gradually, people and the teachers gave me the motivation and
the confidence to perform on stage. Now I have that inner confidence
that we need when we are on stage. If you have that art of music then
you can pursue this line also.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b>Advantages</b>
<br />
There are many advantages for the students which we don’t found in any
other big institutes of music which are as follows:
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b>1. Can complete their diploma from anywhere in India</b>
<br></br>
The main Prayag institute for music is in Allahabad. So it is not
necessary that if you want to apply you have to go to Allahabad or if
you want the diploma you have to study there, it is not necessary. You
can apply online and you can learn anywhere in India with the teachers
or guru’s you are comfortable with. Exams (theoretical and practical) of
this institute is done all over India.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b> 2. The students who have that passion and art but cannot afford the
course
</b>
<br></br>
The students who have the talent to learn and have a passion for music,
Prayag institution is the best place for them to learn. Many big
institutions and their courses of music are way too expensive that
students who can’t afford it cannot take admission there. But Prayag
sangeet samiti offers courses that are affordable to most of them.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br />
Today’s youth prefer more light songs, rock songs, and much more. Prayag
sangeet samiti is the organization which aims to show the culture and
the tradition we have in the past, the way we respect the guru’s who
teach music to us, the way we learn our own Hindustani music to the
coming generations. Thank you for reading.
